echo "🔧 ========================================"

echo ""
echo "🔍 Current Problem:"
echo "   ❌ Database was reset but user didn't logout first"
echo "   ❌ JWT token still stored in browser localStorage"  
echo "   ❌ Frontend thinks user is logged in"
echo "   ❌ Backend user no longer exists"
echo ""

echo "🚀 IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:"
echo ""
echo "1️⃣  Clear Browser Storage (DO THIS NOW):"
echo "   - Open browser Developer Tools (F12)"
echo "   - Go to Console tab"
echo "   - Run: localStorage.clear()"
echo "   - Refresh page (F5)"
echo ""

echo "2️⃣  Login with New Users:"
echo "   After clearing storage, login with:"
echo "   🔑 Admin: admin@rsud.id (password: password123)"
echo "   🏥 Perawat: perawat1@rsud.id (password: password123)"
echo "   📋 Staff: staff1@rsud.id (password: password123)"
echo "   👨‍⚕️ Supervisor: supervisor1@rsud.id (password: password123)"
echo ""

echo "✅ PERMANENT SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:"
echo ""
echo "🛡️  Added InvalidTokenHandler component that will:"
echo "   ✅ Automatically detect invalid JWT tokens"
echo "   ✅ Clear localStorage when backend returns 401/403"
echo "   ✅ Auto-redirect to login page"
echo "   ✅ Prevent this issue in the future"
echo ""

echo "🔄 PREVENTION FOR FUTURE:"
echo ""
echo "When resetting database in the future:"
echo "1. Logout from frontend first (recommended)"
echo "2. OR use the InvalidTokenHandler (now implemented)"
echo "3. OR clear localStorage manually after reset"
