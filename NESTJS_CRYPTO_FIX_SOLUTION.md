# NESTJS CRYPTO MODULE FIX SOLUTION

## Problem Description

The backend was failing to start due to a `ReferenceError: crypto is not defined` error in the NestJS scheduler module. The issue occurs in the `@nestjs/schedule` package, which is trying to use Node.js's built-in `crypto` module without properly importing it.

## Root Cause Analysis

The NestJS scheduler module uses `crypto.randomUUID()` to generate unique IDs for scheduled tasks but doesn't explicitly import the crypto module. In Node.js v18, the crypto module must be explicitly imported before being used.

Error location:

```
/app/node_modules/@nestjs/schedule/dist/scheduler.orchestrator.js:90
        const name = options.name || crypto.randomUUID();
                                    ^
ReferenceError: crypto is not defined
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created a patched Docker configuration

We created a new `Dockerfile.crypto-fix` that includes a patch for the NestJS scheduler module to explicitly import the crypto module before using it.

### 2. Added the crypto module to package.json

Added `"crypto": "^1.0.1"` to the dependencies in `package.json` to ensure the crypto module is available.

### 3. Created a global crypto polyfill

Added a `crypto-polyfill.ts` file that imports and globally exposes the crypto module to ensure it's available throughout the application.

### 4. Added a health check endpoint

Added a `/health` endpoint to the backend API to make it easier to verify if the backend is running correctly.

### 5. Updated Docker compose configuration

Created a new `docker-compose.crypto-fix.yml` file with updated configurations that use the patched Dockerfile.

## How to Apply the Fix

Run the `apply-crypto-fix.sh` script to:

1. Stop all running containers
2. Build the services with the crypto fix
3. Start the containers with the fixed configuration
4. Verify that the backend is running correctly

## Verification Steps

1. Check that the backend container is running without crypto errors
2. Verify the health endpoint is accessible at http://localhost:3001/health
3. Confirm that frontend can connect to the backend and display notifications

## Additional Troubleshooting

If issues persist, check:

- Backend logs: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.crypto-fix.yml logs backend`
- Scheduler-specific logs: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.crypto-fix.yml exec backend grep -r "scheduler" /app/logs`
- Container status: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.crypto-fix.yml ps`
